- This is Windows GUI application for the analysis of biophysical, spectroscopical and neurophysiological data.
- The main functionality is detection and analysis of waveform of small-amplitude signal components of complex time-lapsed waveforms (i.e. miniature neuronal currents and potentials) and components of EPR, ESR, Mossbauer and UV-VIS spectra
- Parameters of signals are evalueted by fitting the model waveforms using multiple regression and gradient optimization techniques
- The application can also perform statistical analysis of the signal parameters distributions using maximal likelihood and autocorrelation techniques

Application has been developed for WindowsXP but can work under Windows7 - 11 using simple compatibility settings

Data formats: multi-column ASCII (tab or comma-delimited), ABF (AxonInstruments), WCP (WinWCP), EDR, FDR (WinFluor, WinLTP)


Application is free to use for research and teaching purposes on the basis of academic collaboration. The documentation and tutorial can be provided on request.
